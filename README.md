# on-fire-dice-game

The original code is by Per Borgen from the Scrimba learning platform.

To the base Dice Game I added an onFire feature. Whenever a player hits a score of 23 or more, that player is "on fire". Being "on fire" means they'll now start the games with their initial score at 3, making their chances of winning that much higher. But the other player still has a  slim chance to get to 20 before a player on fire. If that happens, then the previously "on fire" player loses their fire, and the game commences as usual with both starting at 0 score.
